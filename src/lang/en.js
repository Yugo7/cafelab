        "We are a specialty coffee store, where the beans are imported still green from several countries. The roasting of coffee beans is done as in the 1950s, in a wood-fired oven, preserving and maintaining their original flavors.\n" +
        "Our coffee and accessories are sold in our physical store or online, with complete safety, quality and convenience. We offer coffees from different countries, aromas and intensities, and consumers can choose coffee beans or ground coffee.\n"
