        "The passion for afternoon coffee, the morning flavor, the smell of grandma's house, coffee and cake and even the espresso at the meetings. In each person, passion is born individually, but nothing is as collective as sharing a coffee.\n" +
        "Cafelab is the origin of our passion, which came to share the flavors of roasted beans from various continents.\n" +
        "We are a specialty coffee store, where the beans are imported still green from several countries. The roasting of coffee beans is done as in the 1950s, in a wood-fired oven, preserving and maintaining their original flavors.\n" +
        "Our coffee and accessories are sold in our physical store or online, with complete safety, quality and convenience. We offer coffees from different countries, aromas and intensities, and consumers can choose coffee beans or ground coffee.\n"
